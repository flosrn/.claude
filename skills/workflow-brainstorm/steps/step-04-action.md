<mandatory_rules>
## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST)

- 🎯 FORM clear, defensible recommendations - no wishy-washy conclusions
- 📊 ASSIGN confidence levels HONESTLY - admit uncertainty
- ⚔️ PRESENT the strongest contrarian view - steelman the opposition
- 📋 CREATE actionable next steps - specific, not vague
- 🔗 CITE sources for key claims
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN: Vague conclusions like "it depends" without specifics
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN: Hiding uncertainty behind confident language
</mandatory_rules>

<ultra_think>
**1. ULTRA THINK: Deep Synthesis**

Before producing output, deeply consider:

**What do the phases tell us?**
- Phase 1 (Exploration): The landscape is...
- Phase 2 (Challenge): After stress-testing, the strongest findings are... *(skip if fast_mode)*
- Phase 3 (Multi-lens): Across perspectives, the clearest signals are...

**What's my honest recommendation?**
- If I had to advise someone today, I would say...
- The confidence I have in this is... because...

**What would change my mind?**
- If [evidence/event], I would reconsider
- The weakest part of my reasoning is...

**What's the strongest argument against my recommendation?**
- The best counter-argument is...
- Why someone might reasonably disagree...
</ultra_think>

**2. Generate Final Output**

Produce the final brainstorm output in this format:

```markdown
## 🧠 Brainstorm: {topic}

2. [Question 2] - Why it matters: [impact]
3. [Question 3] - Why it matters: [impact]

**Assumptions that need validation:**
- [Assumption] - How to validate: [method]

---

### Immediate Actions

**This week:**
1. [Specific action 1]
2. [Specific action 2]
3. [Specific action 3]

**Before committing fully:**
- [Validation step or experiment to run]

---

### Sources

**Key references:**
- [Source 1]: [What it contributed]
- [Source 2]: [What it contributed]
- [Source 3]: [What it contributed]

**Perspectives consulted:**
- [Expert/Source] on [topic]
- [Expert/Source] on [topic]
```
</generate_output>

<design_bridge>
**3. Design Bridge** (conditional - only if topic is about building/implementing something)

**DETECT:** Is `{topic}` about building, implementing, creating, or modifying something concrete (a feature, tool, component, system)?

- If **YES** → Execute the Design Bridge below
- If **NO** (pure research, comparison, decision-making) → Skip to step 4 (Save)

**WHY:** Research without design leaves a gap. The best research in the world is useless if it doesn't translate into a clear, validated design before implementation. This bridge absorbs the interactive design validation from brainstorming best practices.

---

**3a. Propose 2-3 Approaches**

Based on ALL research findings (Phases 1-3), propose concrete implementation approaches:

```markdown
---

### Design: Implementation Approaches

Based on the research above, here are the concrete approaches:

#### Approach A: [Name] (Recommended)
- **Architecture:** [High-level structure]
- **Key components:** [What to build]
- **Tradeoffs:** [What you gain vs what you accept]
- **Confidence:** [High/Medium/Low] based on research
- **Why recommended:** [Grounded in specific research findings]

#### Approach B: [Name]
- **Architecture:** [High-level structure]
- **Key components:** [What to build]
- **Tradeoffs:** [What you gain vs what you accept]
- **When to prefer:** [Conditions where B beats A]

#### Approach C: [Name] (optional - only if genuinely different)
- **Architecture:** [High-level structure]
- **Key components:** [What to build]
- **When to prefer:** [Niche conditions]
```

**3b. Present Design Overview**

For the recommended approach, present a design overview scaled to complexity:

```markdown
### Design Overview

**Architecture:**
[2-5 sentences - how the system is structured]

**Components & Data Flow:**
[What pieces exist, how data moves between them]

**Error Handling & Edge Cases:**
[Key failure modes identified by the Skeptic lens]

**Testing Strategy:**
[What to test, informed by research findings]
```

**3c. Validate with User**

Use `AskUserQuestion` to validate the approach:

```
Question: "Which approach should we implement?"
Options:
- "Approach A: [name] (Recommended)" - [1-line rationale]
- "Approach B: [name]" - [1-line rationale]
- "Approach C: [name]" - [1-line rationale] (if applicable)
- "Just the research, no implementation" - Keep research output only
```

Store chosen approach in `{chosen_approach}`.

If user chose "Just the research" → skip to Save step.
</design_bridge>

<save_final>
**4. Save Final Output** (if `{save_file}` is true)

Append to `{session_path}`:
```markdown
## Phase 4: Action Crystallization

[Complete final output above]

[If Design Bridge was executed:]
## Design Decision

**Chosen approach:** [Approach name]
**Rationale:** [Why this approach was selected]

---

## Session Complete

**Total research phases:** 4
**Research completed:** {current_date}
```

Also announce: "Session saved to `{session_path}`"
</save_final>

<implementation_handoff>
**5. Implementation Handoff** (only if Design Bridge was completed and user chose an approach)

**CRITICAL:** This is the bridge between research and implementation. The brainstorm output becomes APEX input.

**5a. Save design context file:**

Write to `.claude/output/brainstorm/{topic-slug}-{date}-design.md`:
```markdown
# Design Context: {topic}

> **Source:** Brainstorm session ({current_date})
> **Approach:** {chosen_approach}
> **Confidence:** {overall_confidence}

## Research-Backed Design

[Architecture, components, data flow from Design Overview]

## Key Constraints (from research)

- [Constraint from Skeptic's warnings]
- [Constraint from Expert's priorities]
- [Constraint from Pragmatist's 80/20]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] [Derived from research insights + design]
- [ ] [Derived from research insights + design]
- [ ] [Derived from research insights + design]

## What to Watch Out For

- [Risk identified in contrarian view]
- [Open question that needs validation during implementation]
```

**5b. Offer APEX handoff:**

Present the user with the next step:

```
---

**Research + Design complete.** Ready to implement.

**Design context saved to:** `.claude/output/brainstorm/{topic-slug}-{date}-design.md`

**To implement with APEX:**
`/apex -a {topic-slug}` — then reference the design context file during the Analyze phase.

Or start APEX manually and point it to the design file for a head start on step-01 (Analyze).
```

**DO NOT automatically invoke APEX.** The user decides when and how to start implementation.
</implementation_handoff>

<confidence_calibration>
## Confidence Level Guidelines

**High Confidence:**
- Multiple independent sources agree
- Survived skeptical challenge
- Multiple perspectives converge
- Clear evidence, minimal assumptions

**Medium Confidence:**
- Good evidence but some gaps
- Some perspectives diverge
- Reasonable assumptions required
- More investigation would help

**Low Confidence:**
- Limited evidence
- Significant uncertainty
- Conflicting perspectives
- Important assumptions untested
</confidence_calibration>

---

<success_metrics>

- Clear, specific recommendations (not "it depends")
- Honest confidence levels with calibration
- Strongest contrarian view presented fairly
- Actionable next steps (specific, not vague)
- Open questions acknowledge what we don't know
- Sources cited for key claims
- Complete output format followed
- [If implementable topic:] 2-3 approaches proposed with tradeoffs
- [If implementable topic:] Design overview with architecture, components, error handling
- [If implementable topic:] User validated chosen approach
- [If implementable topic:] Design context file saved for APEX handoff
</success_metrics>

<failure_modes>

- Vague recommendations that don't commit
- Overconfident conclusions hiding uncertainty
- Weak strawman of contrarian view
- "Next steps" that are too generic to act on
- Forgetting to cite sources
- Rushing the synthesis without ULTRA THINK
- [Design Bridge:] Proposing approaches not grounded in research findings
- [Design Bridge:] Skipping design for "simple" implementable topics
- [Design Bridge:] Auto-invoking APEX without user consent
- [Design Bridge:] Design overview too vague (must include architecture + components + error handling)
</failure_modes>
